Saturation Arithmatic

+, -, *, / functions who's result does not surpass upper and lower limits.
- Overflow safe! Surpassing a limit is predicted before completing the operation instead trying the operation and checking if a limit was surpassed or overflow occurred.
- Hundreds of table driven tests!
- Header only! (This might change/have changed already and I forgor to update this (Check if there's a src directory)).
- Currently the limits are not parametric but instead fixed to the min and max value of the type.

TODO:
- Add limit argument overload so a limit can be spcified instead of just using this to prevent overflow.
- Add divide function. FLT_MAX / 0.1 == FLT_MAX * 10, INT_MIN / -1 == INT_MAX + 1.

Recommanded development command:
./list_watch_files | entr -cs "make test 2>&1 | head -n 40"
- List files to watch for changes
- Use entr to watch for changes on those file and run commands:
	- make test
	- Pipe std{out,err} to head so we see the first errors and don't need to scroll.
